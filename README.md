Project for Cyber Defender Internship.

# What is ARP Network Scanner?

This is an easy to use tool that lets you:
  - Monitor ARP traffic on a live network
  - Read ARP traffic from a .PCAP file
  - Perform an ARP attack on a live network
  
# TODO:

- Implement ARP Spoofing detection that can be used in both monitoring and reading
- Add more descriptive details for code
- Finish reading ARP traffic and ARP attack code
